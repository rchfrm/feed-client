  copy: `To keep it simple, the [daily budget](${ROUTES.BUDGET}) you set in **Feed** is the total amount you’ll spend each day - including our service fee. Our service fee is 10% of your chosen daily budget, dropping to 5% for spend over £150 in the billing month. That means 90–95% of your budget goes on promoting your posts. 

We understand that marketing plans are flexible - if there’s a month when you don’t promote posts through Feed, we won’t charge you anything.
  
In a month where you do spend money promoting posts, to cover our costs we apply a minimum service fee of £2.49.
  
At the end of each billing month, we will charge our service fee to your card and send you an invoice by email. Facebook will bill you separately for the amount spent on promoting your posts.
  
If you think you’re going to spend more than £300 per month consistently, get in touch at [team@getfed.app](mailto:team@getfed.app) to talk about pricing options.`,
