### Choosing geographies

If you're new to digital ads, or unsure of which countries to target, then your home country is a good place to start. Or your home city if you're a very local business!
  
One thing to watch out for: your ads might cost more if you are targeting a very narrow group of people - so it's important to think about the overall population of the locations you have selected. If you're targeting cities, make sure you've selected a few. On the other hand, this needs to be balanced with maximising conversions, so narrow targeting might be important for you!
  
Any questions, feel free to email us [help@tryfeed.co](mailto:help@tryfeed.co)

### Suggested budget
  
The suggested budget makes sure you're spending enough relative to the size of audience you'll be targeting.
  
It also means that Feed can reach new people (${funnelCopy.growA.title} audiences) and retarget people who have engaged with you before, but not recently (${funnelCopy.nurture.title} audiences), to convert people over time into followers, fans and customers.`,
