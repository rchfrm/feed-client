  title: `We're crowdfunding!`,

  intro: `With billions of people online, there is an audience within reach for every creator. The problem is they might not have the time or marketing knowledge to effectively promote themselves and their work.

That’s why we built Feed: a platform that can harness the full potential of social media advertising for musicians and creators.
  
Ultimately, our vision is to give millions of musicians, creators and entrepreneurs of all types the tools to build their businesses - and encourage more and more people to be their own boss.`,

  whyInvestHeader: 'Why invest?',

  whyInvest: `- Since we launched in March, we've been growing at ~33% each month with just under 500 musicians and creators on board.

- Out initial focus has been on music, but we are already seeing demand from other creators and entrepreneurs.

- Small and medium businesses spent an estimated $52bn on Facebook and Instagram ads in 2019, so there's a big market for a product like Feed.

- We've raised over £200k so far, mainly from friends, family and Angel investors.

- Existing platforms are complicated, time-consuming and built for professional marketers. Feed requires no marketing knowledge, works with any level of budget and it takes minutes to get started.
  
- We will begin to charge a service fee on ad budgets in the Autumn - we have had 100% positive user feedback on this pricing model.`,

  outro: `Crowdfunding like this means investment is open to anyone, and the minimum amount you can invest is just £10! We are raising this money in order to market Feed to the millions of musicians and creators out there.
