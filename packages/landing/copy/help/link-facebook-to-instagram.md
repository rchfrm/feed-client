# Link a Facebook Page and Instagram business account

Looking to link Facebook to Instagram or Instagram to Facebook?! It only takes a couple of easy steps to get your business accounts connected.

## Connecting Instagram to Facebook

1. Head to your Facebook business page (https://www.facebook.com/*YOURBUSINESSPAGENAME*) and select settings.

2. Under page settings scroll to Instagram, where you will be taken to a separate page to connect your pages (https://www.facebook.com/*YOUR BUSINESSPAGENAME*/settings/?tab=instagram_management).
